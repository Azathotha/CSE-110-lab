# About Me
## Introduction
![hi](images/cute_rabbit.jpg)
Hi everyone! My name is ***Eugenie***, and I'm a junoir transfer ucsd student majored in CS. </br>
Below is a ***inspiring quote*** that I like:
> I never lose. Either I learn or win.

## My Academics
In the past two quarters, I learned much about algorithm and data structures. This is a class header in a Huffman Code Tree project in the CS class I took last quarter:
```ruby
class HCTree {
    private:
        HCNode* root;
        vector<HCNode*> leaves;

    public:
        HCTree() : root(nullptr) {
            leaves = vector<HCNode*>(256, nullptr);
        }

        ~HCTree();

        void deleteTree(HCNode* &node);
        void build(const vector<int>& freqs);

        void encode(unsigned char symbol, FancyOutputStream & out) const;
        unsigned char decode(FancyInputStream & in) const;
};
```
This is wrote in C++, [my favorite language](README.md).

## My Plan
In a class about planning for the future, we made websites about planing the next four years, here's [my website](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/eng15-project-website/about-me).

Some of my goals:

- [x] Do well in my Fall and Winter classes
- [ ] Apply for tutor
- [ ] Find an internship
- [ ] Apply for graduate school

## My Hobbies
In my free time, I like drawing and playing vedio games. Here's some of my drawings: </br>
